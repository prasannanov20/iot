traffic management using iot
Our ambitious project aims to revolutionize the way commuters navigate through urban traffic by harnessing the power of IoT devices and data analytics. The primary goal is to provide commuters with access to real-time traffic flow and congestion information through a user-friendly public platform or mobile applications. By doing so, we hope to empower commuters to make informed decisions about their routes, thereby contributing to the reduction of traffic congestion and improving overall urban mobility.
